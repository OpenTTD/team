I am really sorry @$USER$, but it seems you modified the template.
You can only modify the template after the "DO NOT modify" marker.
Anything you modify before will result in this reply, and closure of your ticket.

I really am sorry, but I have to be strict about this.
This happens when my masters try to automate this, and you, most likely by accident, made a typo ruining it all.

Please open a new issue from a template, and only modify after the mentioned marker.
Thank you for your understanding.
