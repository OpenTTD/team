<!-- Please do not edit the header of this template. -->

Hi,

I would like to ask for access to help translating OpenTTD and its subprojects into **Hindi**.

The **Hindi** language is well known to me, and I promise to cooperate with my fellow translators to give the end-users the best experience possible.

Thank you,
